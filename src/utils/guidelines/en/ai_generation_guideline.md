## Generative AI Guidelines

These guidelines define the rules for "using generative AI" related to the character "AI Nike-Chan" (hereinafter referred to as "the Character") created by Nike (hereinafter referred to as "the Author"). For general rules such as non-commercial, R-18/R-18G, attribution, distribution/publication, takedown, etc., please follow the "Derivative Creation Guidelines."

Please note that these guidelines may be revised without prior notice. Always check the latest version.

### 1. Scope (AI-Specific)

- Scope: Acts related to generation, learning, conversion, and distribution using generative AI (images/videos/audio/text/3D/motion, etc.).
- General Rules: Non-commercial, adult content (R-18/R-18G), credit/attribution, distribution/publication, takedown, etc. all follow the provisions of the Derivative Creation Guidelines.

---

### 2. Permitted Materials (Must Read)

- Only the following materials are permitted for use:
  - VRM models
  - Logo images
  - Other materials permitted on this website
- Materials other than the above (e.g., Live2D models, existing illustrations, images/videos/audio from streams or thumbnails, screenshots, etc.) cannot be used for generative AI input, reference, learning, or conversion purposes.

- Materials can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/tegnike/nikechan-assets).
- The following images are also available for use. Please save and use the images.

#### Terms of Use for Voice Synthesis Models

- The latest voice synthesis model published in October 2025 can be used only for non-commercial derivative works featuring AI Nike-Chan (videos, streams, voice works, demos, etc.).
- Model data is distributed individually upon application. Please contact us via [Twitter (X) DM](https://twitter.com/tegnike) or [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/G4E5Sf3yj3) with details of your intended use (publication destination, expected genre, presence of monetization features, etc.).
- The following acts are prohibited:
  - Redistribution, transfer to third parties, or sale of model data
  - Recreation of models using synthesized voice obtained from model data

### 3. Rules for Conversion and Learning

- Conversion processing at inference time that does not fall under learning (training) is also included in material use. Therefore, Image-to-Image, Inpainting, style transfer, upscaling, pose/image reference, video/audio conversion, etc. cannot use materials other than permitted materials as input or reference.
- Materials that can be used for learning, fine-tuning, and creating LoRA/Embedding are also limited to "2. Permitted Materials."

---

### 4. AI Use of Others' Derivative Works

- When using derivative works created by others for generative AI learning, conversion, or reference (e.g., Image-to-Image, style transfer, dataset creation, etc.), you must obtain explicit prior permission from the author in question.

---

### 5. Distribution and Publication (AI Output, Models, etc.)

- General rules for distribution and publication (non-commercial, attribution, R-18/R-18G, distribution site settings, takedown, etc.) follow the Derivative Creation Guidelines.
- The scope includes AI-generated content (images, videos, audio, text, etc.), as well as trained models/LoRA/Embedding, workflows, datasets, etc.
- Distribution of models/LoRA/workflows/datasets must also comply with the conditions of Section 3.4 (material distribution) of the Derivative Creation Guidelines.
- AI-specific conditions (scope of permitted materials, permission for others' derivative works) follow Sections 2-4 of these guidelines.
- Use of monetization features (SNS/video): Within the conditions of Section 3.1 of the Derivative Creation Guidelines, use of platform-standard monetization features (ads, tips, memberships, creator funds, etc.) is permitted. Sponsorship contracts/tie-ups, affiliate links, product sales/reservation links, and other external commercial channels are not allowed. Operations follow the consultation necessity criteria defined in Section 3.1 of the Derivative Creation Guidelines. If in doubt, please consult in advance.
- Pricing for digital distribution: Following Section 3.3 of the Derivative Creation Guidelines, download distribution must be free (price 0) only. Optional payments, donations, support plans, or enabling ads are not allowed.

---

### 6. Prohibited Items (AI-Specific)

- Using materials other than permitted materials (3 VRM models, logo) for generative AI input, reference, learning, or conversion.
- Using derivative works for generative AI learning, conversion, or reference without the author's permission.
- Generation or distribution that violates the Derivative Creation Guidelines, platform terms, or laws.
